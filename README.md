# Tested on
* [Live TF2](https://www.teamfortress.com/)
* [Team Fortress 2 Classic](https://tf2classic.com/) - Works well perfectly except Domination mode: it uses voiceline which is used for countdown. Except some music pieces playing every point warning countdowns.
* [Open Fortress](https://openfortress.fun/) - Some voicelines does not play, other than that it works well without any issues
* [Lambda Fortress: Extended](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/lambdafortress) - Some voicelines does not play, other than that it works well without any issues

# Note
* Some of musics had to be removed due to long duration of the music.
